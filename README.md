# Horizen Transaction Application

A lightweight application to search for transactions associated with public addresses (t-address) on the Horizen(ZEN) mainchain blockchain.

## Quick Start

Download one of the releases for your operating system click on the "Add new Address/es" button to add new addresses.

The addresses can be entered either individually, using an xpub (available from the advanced section when you edit your Ledger Live account), or from a csv file with the format (addr,description,name).  

Please note that the xpub and all addresses are stored locally on you computer and only the publicly visible addresses are sent across the internet to get the transaction data.

## Database File Location
Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/HorizenTxHistoryApp

Linux: ~/.HorizenTxHistoryApp

Windows: %APPDATA%\HorizenTxHistoryApp

## Exporting transactions

Transactions can be exported to csv in many different formats for online taxation services.
Currently available export formats are Cointracking, CryptotaxCalculator, Accointing, Koinly, and Unformatted.

Should you require any specific type of csv format, please let me know and I will implement.
